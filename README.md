#### Rust VS Python Scripting
Rust is faster and can be more than twice as fast as Python. Since Rust is compiled directly into machine code, there is no interpreter or virtual machine between the code and the hardware. Another factor that improves the performance of Rust is its memory management.
The assignment took a python script and with automation and generative AI tools, THe script was written with the `Rust` programming language with is efficient than python and performs much better that python with slight syntax similarities.

#### Functions 

The code takes in the `Mtcars.csv` dataset, two columns integer columns are used which give the average of the dataset and creates an `Output.txt` to store the `Average` answer there which is `20.75`

#### Python 

The python file took a much shorter time to run the code with a lot of memory used evidenced by the screen shot as compared to the rust.

#### Rust

The rust code run with little more time but significantly no memory used.
